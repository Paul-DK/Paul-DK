### 🚀 Frontend Developer | Tech Enthusiast | Accessibility Advocate

I'm a **frontend developer in training**, originally from the **UK**, now living in **Denmark** for almost a decade. My journey into tech started in the **1980s**, writing **Locomotive BASIC** on an **Amstrad 464**, and since then, my love for technology has only grown. Now, I'm levelling up my skills in **Frontend Web Development**, with a strong interest in **Accessibility and Responsive Design**.
